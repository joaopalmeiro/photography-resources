### [How & When To Use Texture vs Clarity vs Dehaze in Lightroom | In a Lightroom minute](https://youtu.be/eooN0YeEtyA)

- Texture:
  - "Texture increases or decreases the appearance of texture in your image while (...) retaining details."
  - "(...) targets the "mid-frequency areas" of your images, (...) it only affects the parts of your image where there are no lines or edges."
  - "(...) avoids areas in your image where there are fine details."
  - "(...) great tool to use if you're trying to smooth someone's skin because decreasing frequency will smooth skin while also leaving a person's eyes and mouth sharp and in focus."
- Clarity:
  - "(...) increases or decreases edge contrast, which means (...) it (...) accentuates details in your image."
  - "(...) has a noticeable effect on luminance and saturation."
  - "It's great if you're trying to showcase all the detail on a wall or surface, but not recommended for portraits."
- Dehaze:
  - "Increasing the value (...) allows you to remove atmospheric haze in your image and restore color and contrast to a washed out image."
  - "Because this slider affects contrast and saturation, you don't want to overdo it."
